# Smoothened
A heckin lot of stuff. Ideas from Modern Indicators, Harmony and more. This aims to smooth out all of the knots in Discord, from padding, height adjustments, transitions (🙏), gradients and more. Honestly, who came up with the stripe theme? 🤢 Updates pretty regularly, I guess :3

...licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0, so...

- you can modify the theme
- you can share it

- if you modify it, gotta give me credit 😉
- no profiting/commercial use without express permission 😡


# OI IDIOTS MAKE SURE TO `GIT CLONE` THIS FOR THE AUTO UPDATES
...and if you don't know what that is, why are you using Powercord? 😐
